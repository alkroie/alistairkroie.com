    <h1>Reference from Jenny Chapman, Producer at the BBC</h1>
    <h2>"I have managed Alistair during his time on the BBC Learning Innovations team. He was responsible for project managing the implementation of activities for iWonder guides, developing/designing functional prototypes and implementing processes for content delivery. He has also been involved in the development of our public content platform, iWonder Community. Alistair is a great team player, fun to work with and not afraid to take the initiative. I have been impressed by his quick grasp of complex systems and his holistic approach to working effectively within them." </h2>
